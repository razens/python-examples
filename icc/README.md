# Invariance covariance and contravariant

## Covariance

Enables you to use a more derived type than originally specified.

## Contravariant

Enables you to use a more generic (less derived) type than originally specified.

## Invariance

Means that you can use only the type originally specified. An invariant generic type parameter is neither covariant nor contravariant.
